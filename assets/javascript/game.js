//jQuery should insert an "attack" button once the defender is selected in the charSelect div.

//Every time the player attacks, the game should subtract the amount of the attack from the defender's health, and increase the player's attack. The game should display the totals in the combatMenu div.

//The defender should counterattack at a flat number, which will never increase.

//Once the defender has reached 0 hit points, the character's sprite should be replaced with the dead sprite.

//The player should now pick a new defender to begin combat, and fight each other character in the game.

//If the player's HP runs out, they lose the game and must restart.

//If the player eliminates all other characters, they win the game and are prompted to restart the game.
